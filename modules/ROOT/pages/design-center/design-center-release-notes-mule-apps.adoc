== 1.11.0
*June 15, 2019*

This release includes the following new features and enhancements:

=== New Features

* Publish Mule applications as templates in Exchange
+
You can publish a Mule application to Exchange as a template, which makes it easy for you and other people to create similar Mule applications in the future. Publishing Mule applications as templates is a great way to share your work with other people. When they need to build a similar application, they can get a head start by downloading and using your template to start their own project. If you accompany your template in Exchange with a good description, screenshots, and perhaps even a video, those other people could get going even more quickly.
+
You might even find in the future that you need to create Mule applications that are similar to one that you've already created. Rather than search for a project in Design Center, clone it, and then try to remember what it does and how it works, you can read the page that you wrote for the corresponding template in Exchange.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Templates do not include the authentication credentials that are specified for the connectors used in Mule applications. Authentication credentials are never published. People who use a template to start their own Mule applications must provide their own credentials.
====
+
For more details, see xref::design-center:fd-publish-app-as-template.adoc[Share a Mule Application as a Template on Exchange].

* Create custom expressions in drop-down lists
+
Drop-down lists in cards now allow custom expressions. Scroll to the bottom of a drop-down list and select the option *Custom*. A second field appears below the list field. Into that second field, you can drag the *Custom Expression* data element from the right side of the card. See xref::design-center:custom-expression-field.adoc[Create a DataWeave Expression in a Field] for help using the *Custom Expression* dialog.

////

* Rely on dynamic lists in popular connectors, rather than your memory
+
When filling out cards for popular connectors, such as the Database connector or the Slack connector, in previous releases, you had to remember the names of tables that you wanted to query or Slack channels that you wanted to send messages to. Now, rather than do that, you can click a drop-down list that is populated with the names of tables, the names of Slack channels, or other items, depending on the connector.
////

* Automatic updates of the version of Mule Runtime being used in your projects
+
Now, Flow Designer automatically updates your projects to the latest version of Mule Runtime. These automatic updates ensure that your projects run faster and have fewer errors at runtime.  You can see the Mule Runtime version for your project in the Flow Designer logs or by viewing your project in Runtime Manager.


=== Enhancements

* Get mapping recommendations even for nested object properties
+
If your data types include nested object properties (or arrays), the Transform card can give you recommendations for how to map those properties to other objects.

* Choose data transformations more easily due to descriptive labels
+
As explained in xref::design-center:dynamic-expression-field.adoc[Fill in Cards with Values that Change at Runtime], you can drag data elements into fields in cards, and then expand the data elements to see menus for applying functions to data. The function names are now easier to understand. For example, in the previous release, the labels for three of the functions that you can apply to strings were *Lower*, *Trim*, and *Upper*. In this release, the labels are *Lowercase*, *Remove Extra Whitespace*, and *Uppercase*.

* Enjoy support for Mule Runtime 4.2
+
Flow Designer now runs on Mule Runtime 4.2. Enjoy a stabler, more reliable experience.


== 1.10.0
*May 4, 2019*

This release contains one new feature and fixes on issue.

=== New Feature

Importing a template is now the easiest way to get started creating a Mule application in Flow Designer.  A template is a pre-built integration that you can customize. Go to Anypoint Exchange to see templates for the most popular integration use cases. You can open templates in read-only mode in Flow Designer and review them. If you believe that a template will help you create the Mule application that you need, you can switch to edit mode, customize it, and then test and deploy it.

=== Fixed Issue

// PROJECTX-4044
The format of transformation scripts that are generated by recommended mappings in the Transform card is now consistent with the format of transformation scripts that are generated by manual mapping.

== 1.9.0
*April 6, 2019*

This release contains the following new features and enhancements.

// From Badi's draft release announcement: Anypoint Design Center - flow designer: New Comments in cards available; Preview of data pills with live data after running app; New visual function editor supported functions; New create project modal;

=== New Features

* When you click the *Create* button that is on top of the list of projects in Design Center, a new dialog appears with clearer choices for project types.
*
* You can now add notes to cards. Here are some examples of why you might add notes:
** To explain the purpose of using a card in a flow
** To remind yourself of tasks you still need to complete in a card
** To log changes that you make to a card
// * When you open an existing Mule application after a new version of Mule runtime is released, Design Center will display a message stating that the application now uses the latest version of Mule runtime. The Mule application will then restart. This feature ensures that Mule applications are always using the latest version of Mule runtime. https://mulesoft.slack.com/archives/G1GE46NQL/p1554142341009300?thread_ts=1554132676.000800&cid=G1GE46NQL

=== Enhancements

The previous release included this enhancement:

** _If you drag and drop a payload element, attribute, or variable into a plain text field, you can click the element, attribute, or variable to see functions for transforming the value and a preview of what the value will be._

For the 1.9.0 release, more functions have been made available, including some mathematical functions that take parameters. The additional functions are:

* For integers: absolute value, modulus, raise to a power, round, and square root
* For strings: convert to uppercase, convert to lowercase, and trim off surrounding spaces

Also, you can now see previews of live data when a Mule application is running.


== 1.8.0
*March 9, 2019*

This release contains the following new features and enhancements.

=== New Features

* The new *Problems* pane lists errors in the currently open project. Open the pane by clicking *Problems* in the lower-right corner of the canvas. Click an error to be shown where you can resolve that error.
* You can import a Mule-application project that was exported from Design Center. This feature is useful when you want to continue developing a Mule application in an environment in Anypoint Platform that is different from the environment in which the application was created.


=== Enhancements

* Display descriptions of the operations to choose from when you add new cards to your flows. When you add a card, the list of operations is opened automatically. Mouse over any operation to display an icon to the right of the operation's name. Mouse over the icon to see a description of the operation.
* If you drag and drop a payload element, attribute, or variable into a plain text field, you can click the element, attribute, or variable to see functions for transforming the value and a preview of what the value will be.
* If you drag and drop a "custom expression" element into a text field and then display the *Custom Expression* dialog to build an expression, you can click any DataWeave function in the right-hand pane of the dialog to see a description and examples of that function.
* Use the Remove Variable card to remove a variable from a flow.


////
== 1.7.2
*January 10, 2019*

This release includes one new feature.

=== New Feature

* You can import a Mule-application project that was exported from Design Center. This feature is useful when you want to continue developing a Mule application in an environment in Anypoint Platform that is different from the environment in which the application was created.
////

== 1.7.1
*January 2, 2019*

This release includes the following new feature and enhancement.

=== New Feature

In the Transform card, you can view recommendations for how to map the data elements in an input payload to the data elements in an output payload. If a recommendation suits your needs, you can click *Apply* to save the mapping and use it in the card.

=== Enhancement

Mule Runtime 4.1.5 is now supported. All new Mule-application projects use 4.1.5 by default.



== 1.7.0
*December 15, 2018*

This release includes the following new features, enhancements, and fixes.

=== New Features

* You can drag and drop payload elements, attributes, and variables into plain text fields, mixing them together with text or using them alone, to specify dynamic, rather than static, values. The values are substituted when your Mule application is running and a flow is triggered.
* You can create DataWeave expressions in plain text fields, mixing expressions with text or using them alone, to create dynamic values when flows are triggered at runtime. A new editor provides aids for creating expressions.
* You can change an existing Mule application to use a newer version of Mule Runtime. You might want to do this if the newer version includes updates or new features that you want your application to take advantage of.



=== Enhancements

Mule Runtime 4.1.4 is now supported. All new Mule-application projects use 4.1.4 by default.

=== Fixed Issues

// PROJECTX-4045
* Suggestions in expression editors in the Choice and Try cards were partially obscured.
// PROJECTX-4314
* In the Transform card, you can set an expression for an element in an output payload by double-clicking the element. In the dialog that opens, a value is required. It was possible in the previous release to click *OK* to exit the dialog even if there was no value specified.
// PROJECTX-4698
* It was possible to create custom data types for unsupported MIME types.


== 1.6.0
*November 17, 2018*

This release includes the following enhancements and fixes.

=== Enhancements

* A Transform card no longer displays an error if there is no sample data. Transform cards now display a hint that sample data needs to be present.
* You can return to the list of Design Center projects by clicking the name "Design Center" at the top of the canvas. The back arrow that was present in the top-left corner in previous releases has been removed.

=== Fixed Issues

* View in Runtime Manager doesn't work when the current Runtime Manager environment is not the design environment.
* The Set Expression functionality in a Transform card doesn't disable the *OK* button if the text is blank.

* An informational message is visible after a project is closed.
* There is no way to read the type of the output in the Slack connector.
* Visual Function Editor displays odd behavior when a DataWeave script is pasted as a value.
* Visual Function Editor does not show an entire configured DataWeave script.
* A Mule application hangs in *Starting Application* state when mapping a value to a variable with DataWeave.
* Uploading a library results in a Bad Gateway error.
* The deployment services fail when a deployment's status is checked.
* In an old project that uses Runtime 4.1.0, there is no vertical scrollbar in the list of triggers.
* Configurations created from the sidebar can't be used in cards.
* The generic database configuration errors aren't computed correctly.

== 1.5.5
*October 20, 2018*

This release includes the following new feature, enhancements, and fixes.

=== New Feature
// PROJECTX-4593
You can now prevent connectors that are listed in Anypoint Exchange from being used in Mule applications. If you have permission to edit assets in Anypoint Exchange, you can add the `nofdsupport` tag to the list of tags for a connector; afterward, that connector will not be available for Mule applications being created in Design Center.

=== Enhancements
// PROJECTX-4838
* When you drag and drop message objects from the Visual Function Editor into function fields, you can position the object anywhere in an existing expression.
// PROJECTX-4041
* In Transform cards, the Output Payload section is now expanded by default if the payload contains data types.
// PROJECTX-3721
* As in previous releases, when you are adding a card to a flow, you can start typing the name in the *Select a Component* dialog to filter the list of components. Now, when you have filtered the list down to one component, you no longer have to click on that component to select it. You can simply type *Enter*.

=== Fixed Issues

//PROJECTX-4432
* If changes were made to a Mule app while the status was “Starting Application”, the status continued to change to “Running” and the changes were not applied. The status should have reverted to “Ready to Run” and the changes applied.
// PROJECTX-4441
* The error count displayed on the sidebar could be different from the error counts displayed on a flow and at the top of the canvas.
// PROJECTX-4464
* On Microsoft Windows 10 and in the Edge browser, icons and names were too distant from each other in the display of the list of triggers in the *Let’s Get Started* wizard.
// PROJECTX-4526
* An error was not added to the error count if a driver was not specified in a *Database* card.
// PROJECTX-4528
* Cards for scopes, such as the *For Each* and *Choice* cards, require at least one card to follow them. If a scope card did not yet have a card following it, an error was counted both on the scope card and on the plus icon next to it.
// PROJECTX-4888
* The Search endpoint that is exposed in the Mozart xAPI was filtering out assets from Anypoint Exchange that did not have mule-plugin files. However, this behavior became incorrect when REST APIs started to be converted to connectors automatically in Exchange. These connectors do not have `mule-plugin` files.
// PROJECTX-4902
* In a *Logger* card, dragging the `Type` attribute into the *Message* field would remove any other attributes that were already in that field.
// PROJECTX-4903
* In an *HTTP Request* card, if you typed the beginning of a URL in the *URL* field, dragged `Custom Expression` into the field from the Visual Function Editor on the right, created a custom expression, closed the card, and then reopened the card, the URL field would be empty.
// PROJECTX-4940
* In some cases, it was possible to click the *Upload* button to select a database driver to upload before the *Database* card populated a list of available drivers. If you tried to upload a driver that was already available to Design Center, then the error message "An asset already exists with that name and version" would appear and the upload would fail.
// PROJECTX-4941
* Several problems that prevented log content from being copied easily have been fixed.
// PROJECTX-4948
* In some cases, it was difficult to delete a message object that had been dragged into a field from the Visual Function Editor.
// PROJECTX-5122
* The icon on a card would disappear if you downgraded to an earlier version of the asset that the card represented.
// PROJECTX-5123
* Some cards were not sized correctly when they were opened.
// PROJECTX-5132
* The `$` symbol was causing errors in the Visual Function Editor.
// PROJECTX-5171
* Dragging a message object from the Visual Function Editor into a field would sometimes add extra spaces to the end of the text input in that field. The spaces could be difficult to remove.
// PROJECTX-5173
* Adding an `if/then/else` statement to a message object that was in a field would prevent text input after the object.
// PROJECTX-5190
* Dragging a message object into a field could delete white space that was in the field.
// PROJECTX-5241
* In some cases, mapping the output of a *Transform* card to a variable and then clicking the *Run* button could lead to an application being stuck in the *Starting Application* state.
// PROJECTX-4313
* In the *Output Payload* pane of a *Transform* card, if you right-clicked an attribute, selected *Set Expression*, set the value, and then quickly clicked *OK*, the new value would not take effect. You had to set the value, pause for a few seconds, and then click *OK*.



== 1.5.1

*September 8, 2018*

This release includes the following enhancements and fixes. There were also several improvements to security.

=== Enhancements

* The new Visual Function Editor lets you drag and drop message objects into function fields.
* Automapping (Beta) is now available when a source card and a destination card are placed around a Transform card.
* You can zoom out of the canvas to a limit of 17% magnification.
* You can now design Mule apps on 720p monitors.
* The tool for designing Mule apps now uses Mule Runtime 4.1.3.


=== Fixed Issues

* It was possible for cards to overlap the name of the current flow, which appears in the top-left corner of the canvas.
* Open Try cards overlapped other cards within the Try scope.
* If you selected text in a function field, after an interval of 5 to 10 seconds, the text would be deselected automatically.
* If you pressed Shift+Option+up while your cursor was on a line in a function field, the field duplicated the line. This problem occurred only on systems running macOS.
* At rare times, if you clicked the Run button, the status message would change from “Ready to run” to “Starting application” and then return to “Ready to run”, never reaching the state “Running”.
* The checkboxes in the Type card for Try scopes were misaligned
* It was possible to change to a deprecated version of a connector.
* If you dragged the log panel to its full height, the text on the Expand Logs button on the right side of the top bar of the panel did not change to Collapse Logs. Also, you had to click the button twice for the panel to collapse.
* Fixes to error counts:
+
** The number of errors that are in a flow are always indicated in two locations:
*** For an entire flow, the number of errors appears next to the name of the flow in the sidebar.
*** For each card, the number of errors appears on the top-right corner of the card.
+
The resolved issue was that if a card lacked a configuration, an error would be counted for the card but not for the entire flow.

** If a card requires a driver, but no driver is selected for it, the count of errors for the card should be incremented by 1. This increment was not occurring.
** If a card required another card to follow it, but no subsequent card had yet been added, the error count on the original card was incremented by 1, and the + symbol displayed an error count of 1. Therefore, one error was counted twice.
** When a For Each card is created, it is created with an error count of 1 because the scope requires a card. The resolved issue was that, if a card was moved into the scope, the error went away, as it should have; however, if the added card was removed, the error count on the For Each card was not incremented by 1.

* Fixes to connectors:
** Under certain conditions, the Microsoft ServiceBus Anypoint Connector would log this error message:
+
`ERROR 20:34:47   Could not serialize object of type: 'class org.mule.modules.microsoftservicebus.extension.api.entity.AmqpMessage' to JSON. Error: StackOverflowError:`

* Fixes to support for DataWeave:
** Support for the Infix notation did not work.
** It was not possible to create a custom type from a payload.

== 1.5.0

*August 25, 2018*

This release includes the following enhancements and fixes.

=== Enhancements

* The speed and accuracy of mapping recommender within the Transform card has been improved.
* When you configure a Database card to use a Derby connection, Microsoft SQL Server connection, or MySQL connection, a default driver is selected automatically. Therefore, you no longer need to upload a driver unless you want to use a specific one.
* When deploying a working Mule application to a new environment, most of the time you do not have to change the configuration of the connectors. Therefore, in the Deploy Mule Application to CloudHub dialog, the fields for changing the configuration values for connectors are no longer visible unless you click the new *Advanced* button.
* In the *Logs* section, you can now hover over a line and click *COPY* to copy a line of text.
* The left-pane is now collapsed by default when projects for Mule applications first open.
* Payload attributes are now listed on the left side of all cards other than cards used as triggers and Transform cards. They are listed to make it easier for you to work in the visual function editor, which is available for many fields.

=== Fixed Issues

* The *Script* tab on the Transform card was disabled in some scenarios. The tab is now always enabled.
* In For Each cards, it is now possible to delete the default expression that is in the *Collection* field, which is `payload`. In the previous release, there was an issue that prevented this default value from being deleted.
* Script errors are now flagged where they occur in the Transform card and in all fields that take DataWeave expressions. Such errors also now prevent applications from being run.
* When an icon is missing for a connector, a custom default icon appears in its place, rather than the "missing image" icon that appears by default in browsers.
* Several issues in the *Logs* section were fixed.


== 1.4.7

*July 12, 2018*

This release includes enhancements and fixed issues that are related to designing Mule applications.

=== Enhancement

* You can now hover your mouse cursor over the name of a card to see a tooltip with the card's full name. You no longer have to open a card to see its full name.
* When you rename a card, you can now specify a name that is up to 50 characters long. In previous releases, the maximum number of characters was 15.
* If you rename the card for an HTTP Listener, the name can now contain forward slashes.



=== Fixed Issues

* The option to restart your workspace was available while the workspace was being created. If you selected the option during the creation of your workspace because you thought that the creation process had stalled, the creation process would restart, leading to further delay before your project was ready for you to work in.
* You can now rename the operations that are displayed on cards the Choice, For Each, Transform, and Try components.
* An issue could occur in an HTTP Listener card if you opened the card, clicked *Responses*, and clicked the *Map* button for the *Body* field in the *Error Response* section. Each array has an options icon. If you click this icon, the menu that appears allows you to set an expression. However, if an array contained at least one item, the options icon disappeared from the entry for the array. The option for setting an expression then appeared on the menu opened by clicking the options icon for the first array item, as in this image.

image::design-center/dcfd147issue.png[]

* If you typed in a text field in a card and then clicked the *&fnof;(x)* button to open function editor, what you had typed was deleted, though it should have remained in the field.
* If a user that had the Design Center Developer role, but that did not have the CloudHub administrator role, opened a project, the project was locked in read-only mode with the status message set to "Loading…". The project remained locked for five minutes.
* It was possible to deploy an application even if a script in a Transform card contained errors.
* The *Save* button was not enabled in the *Edit Type* dialog that appears when you edit the output data type in an error response for an HTTP Listener.
* If you were working in a Mule-application project, logged out of Design Center by clicking your profile icon in the top-right corner and selecting *Sign Out*, logged into Design Center again, and attempted to reopen the project, you would encounter this message: `Project locked: This project is currently being used by another user. You will be redirected to the project list.`
* When more than one type was specified in the subcard of a Try card and the subcard was subsequently closed, reopening the subcard displayed the *Type* and *When* fields, as well as the *Log Exceptions*, and *Enable Notification* check boxes, shifted to the left.
* In a Transform card, if you mapped an input field to an output field, selected the parent field in the list of output fields, removed the mapping, and then mapped another input field to an output field, this second mapping would not be displayed correctly. Switching to another tab in the card, such as *Script* or *Sample data*, and then switching back would cause the mapping to appear correctly.


== 1.4.6

*June 16, 2018*

This release includes new features, enhancements, fixed issues, and known issues for designing Mule applications.

=== New Features and Enhancements

* When you select the option to restart your workspace, you will be asked to give your reason for doing so. Your responses will help MuleSoft assess the stability of the user interface.
* The error messages related to running and deploying applications are improved.
* If you do not reopen an existing project for five days, the worker for it is terminated. In past releases, when you reopened a project after that amount of time, a new worker was not provisioned for the project until you opened a card, which could cause longer than expected wait times for the values in the card to appear. Now, when you reopen a project 5 days after last using it, a new worker is provisioned for the project immediately.
* The navigation bar at the top of the screen has been redesigned to improve the experience of running and deploying applications.

=== Fixed Issues

* The panel that shows the log for an application now expands and collapses more smoothly.
* The MIME Type and Encoding options on the Set Payload and Set Variable cards are now removed and the values are set to the appropriate defaults.

=== Known Issues
The known issues that were in the 1.4.5 release continue into this release:

* REST Connect connectors display their `artifactId`, instead of their name.
* The option to set an expression for repeated elements is temporarily disabled because this option is not currently supported by the DataWeave API.
* In some cases, the list of items in drop-down fields extends below the boundary of the current card, as in this image:
+
image::design-center/dc-menu-problem.png[]
* If you use 5.1.33 or later versions of the MySQL driver in a Database connector, your Mule application might run out of memory.

== 1.4.5

*May 31, 2018*

This release includes new features, enhancements, resolved issues, and known issues for designing Mule applications.

=== New Features and Enhancements

* An improved algorithm for mapping suggestions in the Transform component.
* Support for the Set Payload and Set Variable components.
* Automatic naming of flows created by the Getting Started wizard. For example, if you use the wizard to create a flow with the following components:
  ** Trigger: An HTTP component with _Listener_ selected as its operation
  ** Target: A Database component with _Insert_ selected as its operation

+
Then, the default name for your flow is _HTTP listener to Database insert_.
* Support for renaming the operations that are displayed on cards. On a card, open the actions menu by clicking the three-dots icon and then select *Rename Card*. This option is not present on these cards: Choice, For Each, Transform, Try.
* Automatic selection of the latest driver type for the selected connection type in the Database connector. When you open the *Database Drivers* dialog to select a database driver, the latest version is automatically selected after you click the arrow in the selection field.

=== Fixed Issues

* Several bugs in functioning of the Transform card were fixed.
* Several minor bugs in user interface were fixed.

=== Known Issues
The known issues that were in the 1.4.0 release continue to be in this release:

* Rest Connect connectors display their `artifactId`, instead of their name.
* The option to set an expression for repeated elements is temporarily disabled because this option is not currently supported by the DataWeave API.
* In some cases, the list of items in drop-down fields extends below the boundary of the current card, as in this image:

=== 1.0

*July 29, 2017*


This release includes the new web-based Design Center that enables you to easily create web-based integration flows, design API specifications, and create reusable API fragments.

==== Flow designer

With release you can:

* Create and manage Mule application projects.
* Design flows using a simple step-by-step process with the ability to quickly navigate to Exchange to see more information.
* Connect to systems and protocols using different connectors, including databases, FTP, HTTP, SOAP web services, Salesforce, Workday, and others.
* Support for REST connect, which provides a connector in the component selector for every API that is published in Exchange. This enables you to discover APIs as part of your design process and consume them without having to know the details of how the API works.
* Perform complex data transformations using DataWeave with a visual drag-and-drop editor.
* View live data, so you can easily debug your flows.
* Create and manage data types for XML, JSON, CSV, and objects.
* Control the flow of data:
** Choice Router enables you to make logical decisions and route to specific event processors or other flows.
** For Each Scope enables you to loop over payload content.
** Try Scope enables you to incorporate error-handling logic into your flows. Using error handlers, you can select specific error types that could occur, and define a behavior to deal with each.
** Flow Refs enable you to call out to other flows from your main flow.
* Store and retrieve information from the Mule Object Store.
* Use design environments, which enable you to develop applications using flow designer, without consuming your Sandbox vCores.
* Manage dependencies, so you can control the versions of your connectors and modules, to upgrade or downgrade at any time.

Underpinning this release is the initial release of Mule 4.0 Runtime. This release is currently only available to Design Center users. More details on what’s new in Mule 4 can be found in the Mule Runtime section.


==== API designer

This release of Design Center enables you to:

* Edit RAML API specifications and fragments.
* Publish and consume reusable API fragments, so that common best practices, data types, or security schemes can be reused across APIs.
* Mock and test APIs.
* Import and export Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0.
* Create and delete branches for your API specification or fragment.
* View projects in edit and read-only mode to avoid conflicts in collaboration.
* See suggestions and discover RAML syntax via a “shelf” built.
* Preview your API with the new RAML console.
