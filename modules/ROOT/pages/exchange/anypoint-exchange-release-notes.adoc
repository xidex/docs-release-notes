== May 2019

=== New Features

* Improved readability of API instances when requesting API access, especially for long API instance names. (EXC-3636)
* When using direct upload, provide relevant information about the files that should be uploaded for each asset type. (EXC-3427)
* Users can now customize the order of the user-generated pages in the public portal. (EXC-3405)

* Exchange now xref:exchange::to-find-info.adoc[searches] properties defined in RAML and OAS API specifications and the full text of asset portal page content. Users no longer need to create complex tags and categories to enable finding assets, since they can now search the API docs and API specs in addition to name, categories, and tags. (EXC-2967)

=== Fixed in this Release

* When creating a SOAP API, the "File URL" link is now validated. File URLs entered with no protocol before validation was enabled will be updated to default to `http`. (EXC-3641)

* Users can now upload assets using relative file paths in an `anypoint-cli` interactive session. (EXC-3423)
* Unauthenticated access to portal images is disabled for images uploaded after this update. To disable unauthenticated access to an image uploaded before this update, download it, remove it, and xref:exchange::to-describe-an-asset.adoc#add-an-image[upload it again]. (EXC-3394)
* Prevent inconsistent asset type across multiple versions of an asset. (EXC-3392)
* Making a version of an API public now depends on validation of that version and not on validation of uncompleted versions. (EXC-3336)
* The browser back button now displays the correct pages in all cases. (EXC-3334)

== April 2019

=== New Features

* Adding multiple tags to an asset is now easier. After a user types the tag and presses enter, a new tag is automatically started. (EXC-3431)
* Exchange events, such as the most recent asset details page visited in Exchange, are now shown in the Recent Items list in the common Anypoint Platform navigation bar. (EXC-3264)
* Users can now delete a draft of portal documentation. Previously users could only delete by editing the draft, removing all new edits, and publishing. When there were multiple changes in the draft, it could be difficult to tell which edits belonged to the draft and which to the old version. With the new option to delete a draft, users can have confidence that the right changes will be discarded automatically, preserving the original documentation content. (EXC-3116)
* Added information messages when trying to create a page with an invalid name in the Asset Detail Page to explain why the validation failed and how the user can make the page name valid. (EXC-3041)
* All policy URLs now have MuleSoft domains, so whitelists for API policies now require only MuleSoft URLs. No need to also add Amazon S3 URLs. (EXC-2680)
* Users can now automate the publishing process by using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to upload RAML and OAS specifications to Exchange. (EXC-2539)

=== Fixed in this Release

* Exchange now generates the correct representation of mocking service URLs for OAS specifications. (EXC-3478)
* To prevent hackers from accessing the authorization token from the request header, the authorization token is no longer included in the request header in each request made with API Console. (EXC-3416)
* Enabled filtering by asset type in the public portal. (EXC-3400, EXC-3390)
* If the user creates a Terms and Conditions page to supplement their asset documentation page, the Terms and Conditions page is now visible at all times. (EXC-3383)
* Added `jpeg` to the list of supported extensions for portal resources (`bmp`, `gif`, `ico`, `jpe`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`, `svg`, `tif`, `tiff`, `webp`). (EXC-3351)
* If the user selects the *API is behind firewall* option, navigates away, and returns, the selection is now remembered. (EXC-3335)
* Provided guardrails to prevent users from creating more than 50 pages in the documentation of a single asset. This prevents wasting unnecessary resources to support an unlimited number of pages. (EXC-3157)
* Prevented users from creating portal contents without an associated file when publishing API specifications. (EXC-2541)

== March 2019

=== New Features

* Enable customers to use the Try It panel for API instances that are behind their firewall. (EXC-3117)

=== Fixed in this Release

* Links to websites outside the MuleSoft Public Exchange no longer show a blank page. (EXC-3172)

* Accurate warning and error displayed when the user has reached the Maximum Page limit of 10 pages per portal in Public Portal. (EXC-3054)
* There is no limit on the number of client applications or contracts visible to the user when the user tries to request access for an API or browses the client applications in the "My Applications" page. Previous limit was 200. (EXC-3017)
* Enable customers to add custom headers in the Try It panel in the Exchange Portal API Console. (EXC-3008)
* Maven dependencies for the test scope are no longer visible in the dependencies section in Exchange. (EXC-2624)
* Correct error message when trying to publish an OAS 3 specification, since OAS 3 is not supported. (EXC-2552)
* New error message reflects the correct information when an attempt is made to create a new asset with the same GroupID-AssetID-Version (GAV) as an asset deleted within the past 7 days. Error message changed from "Asset already exists. Choose another asset name or version." to "There is a deleted asset with the same version number. Try creating your new asset with a higher version number." (EXC-2484)
* Validate that a published WSDL has either a WSDL file or a URL for a WSDL file, and not both. (EXC-2354)

== February 2019

=== New Features

* Syntax highlighting in asset description markdown content. (EXC-3226)
* Faster contextual navigation with clickable tags and categories in asset details page. By clicking on a tag or category, Exchange triggers a search of all of the assets that contain that tag or category. (EXC-3227)
* Easy drag and drop image upload on Exchange's markdown editor. (EXC-3228)

=== Fixed in this Release

* The organizationId field is mandatory when publishing assets through Exchange xAPIs. Previously not sending organizationId returned a misleading 404 (Not Found) error. Now not sending organizationId returns an accurate 400 (Bad Request) error. (EXC-3168)
* Public portals that use vanity domains to promote their company domain name can now render the API Console. API Console enables users to explore the API spec and try it out. (EXC-3143)
* When a user goes to edit mode from a page that does not exist in the draft, Exchange now opens the home page in edit mode without an error. (EXC-2992)
* Maven Facade now returns user-friendly and relevant error message text and code when internal services fail to validate a Mule asset. (EXC-2911)
* Previously exceeding the rate limit for the underlying authentication service returned a misleading 401 (Unauthorized) error. Now exceeding the rate limit for the underlying authentication service returns an accurate 429 (Too Many Requests) error. (EXC-2900)
* Exchange now prevents users from uploading compressed (zip) files whose uncompressed contents will exceed the maximum allowed size limit. Users will receive a 413 (Payload Too Large) HTTP error. (EXC-2527)
* Allow Cyrillic text in category names. (EXC-2461)

== January 2019

=== New Features

* Conversion from RAML to OAS 2.0 and from OAS 2.0 to RAML in the publication process.
* Ability to download a REST API specification in either RAML or OAS 2.0 with identification of the "Generated" specification.
* Direct upload of RAML and RAML fragments.
* New API console experience.
* Consistent API specification publication user interface between Exchange and API Manager.
* Contextual view of RAML versions of API specifications and fragments in API designer from Exchange.

=== Version Note

The Exchange versions have changed from version numbers to date versioning by year and month.

== 2.7

*October 2018*

=== New Features

* Exchange provides master organization scope search and browse for all assets in a master organization, irrespective of which business groups users belong to. Users are no longer limited to finding assets within their own business group.
* Vanity domain for public portals - Customers can now set their own domain name for their developer portal. This enables a more personalized and consistent branding experience, where you can use your own domain names. This also improves your search engine optimization(SEO) when your customers and users are searching for APIs that are specific to your domain. See xref:exchange::portal-vanity-domain.adoc[Public Portal Vanity Domain].
* Limits on Custom asset files - Prevents users from uploading malicious file contents as Custom types. See xref:exchange::to-create-an-asset.adoc#create-a-custom-asset[Create a Custom Asset].
