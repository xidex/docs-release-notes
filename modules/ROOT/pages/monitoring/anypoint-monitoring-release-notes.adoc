The retention period for API analytics is increasing to 90 days for Gold and Platinum subscriptions. 

== June 12, 2019

Anypoint Monitoring support for Mule 3.9.x-AM and Mule 4.x-AM is being deprecated. 

Update your applications to run on mainline Mule versions (3.9.x and 4.x) for better functionality, improved performance, and the latest patch updates as soon as they are available.

If you currently have Anypoint Monitoring enabled for applications running on 3.9.x-AM or 4.x-AM, monitoring will continue to work, but you will not receive important patch updates. 

For information about setting the runtime version for your Mule app and enabling monitoring, see xref:monitoring::configure-monitoring-cloudhub.adoc[Configure and Enable Anypoint Monitoring for Mule Apps].

== December 15, 2018
This release contains the following new features:

* *API Analytics* - API Analytics is now available in Anypoint Monitoring. See xref:monitoring::api-analytics-dashboard.adoc[Builtin API Analytics Dashboard].
* *Anypoint Custom Metrics Connector* - (Requires a Titanium subscription) The Anypoint Custom Metrics connector enables sending metric values with dimensions to Anypoint Monitoring, where they can be visualized in real time using Custom Dashboards. See xref:connectors::metrics/custom-metrics-connector.adoc[Custom Metrics Connector].

== December 8, 2018
This release contains the following new features:

* *Log Points* - (Requires Titanium subscription) You can generate logs for a running API without writing any code or redeploying your application. You can select specific parameters within the API for which to generate logs, for example, the request header `host` parameter. For more information about log points, see xref:monitoring::log-points.adoc[Anypoint Monitoring Log Points]
* *Connector-level Flow Analysis* - (Requires Titanium subscription) You can now monitor the performance for connectors. For more information about monitoring connectors, see xref:monitoring::monitor-connectors.adoc[Monitor Connectors]


=== Known Issues

The Anypoint Monitoring log points feature is only supported on Mule runtime engine version 3.8.5-AM or later. For APIs not running on Mule runtime engine 3.8.5-AM or later, the log points feature does not appear for the API.

Since you can't select the runtime version when you deploy an API from API Manager, you need to navigate to Runtime Manager, select the runtime version (3.8.5-AM or later), then redeploy the API.

[NOTE]
Mule runtime engine versions appended with `-AM` are listed in Runtime Manager, in the *Runtime Version* menu under *Show old patch releases*. 

=== Fixed Issues

* General bug fixes.

** Resources are prefetched on page load.
** Changes to built-in dashboards load more quickly.
** Extended connection pools life before timeout.
* Improvements to Deployment and Management:

** Provisioning Configuration Management: Allows for changes to the data sources without requiring a new deployment. Versioning to allow controlled roll out.
** Log Orchestration Service updates periodically from the Provisioning System: allows the creation of an Organization log index without requiring a deployment.
** Admin console now exposes data from Provisioning: it allows easier visualization and editing of the environment properties.
* Minor user experience (UX) improvements.
